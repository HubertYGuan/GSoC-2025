Firstly, I have implemented the semaphores for sys_heap functions that I mentioned earlier. However, I have not extensively tested the new multithreaded sys_heap behavior with these semaphores. It seems like there are no current conflicts with the WiFi thread running in the external heap and the main thread interacting with the external heap at least.

The reality is that ippeveprinter is 8k lines of code without some kind of modular testbench and that it is clearly not written for embedded systems (besides embedded Linux devices, which have traits of traditional computer systems). It has also become a debugging nightmare to get through since logs are not clear as to what exactly is going wrong and there is not much comparison with regular ippeveprinter on Linux since most of the logs disappear if nothing goes wrong. Furthermore, step-through debugging is not the best when testing a real-time connection HTTP connection that can timeout. Lastly, it takes a lot of overhead time just to reset my testing setup since ippfind can often have trouble finding ippeveprinter.

Surprisingly (or unsurprisingly due to reasons I will get into), I have not had that much time to work on this project despite classes being basically nonexistent in terms of assignments (with the exception of the embedded systems course ECE 153a that makes me go into Vivado even before the first lecture). The main thing that has been taking up my time is working on a new initiative with the ACM student chapter at UCSB, which involves managing communications with much of the faculty from two departments and many meetings for event planning.

I was able to figure out how to get ippeveprinter recognized as a printer by CUPS, but I’ve also had a lot more issues with processing jobs.
First, I noticed that I have to load a test.conf file, or else seemingly every job will fail when running on my local machine. It turns out that the load_ippserver_attributes is very memory-intensive, and I was only able to get it to work after increasing a bunch of stack sizes in the kconfig (see source code). This means that I have only about 5% of my DRAM available for the heap, and I am also unsure if my pthread stacks are large enough to handle the HTTP functions either.

Now, mostly DNS-SD and networking work remains to be done.
As for the previous issue I faced, I figured out that it was caused by a lack of available stack memory for ippeve_main and that I actually had to malloc the stack myself since the default pthread_attr allocation method conflicts with the net management allocations for some reason (if I allocate one, the other will fail to allocate unless I set the stack size low enough).

I was able to resolve the previous issues about pthreads for now, as well as most of my previous issues with debugging, but there is now a whole new suite of issues for me to deal with.

I’ve learned more about how Zephyr handles concepts like pthreads and how they can be a lot more difficult to deal with than on Linux. I also recently received my ESP32s3 board, so I have also been testing the application there as well.
ippeveprinter Update Luckily, it seems that using the previously mentioned syscalls like pipe, dup, and execve are not entirely necessary for the functioning of ippeveprinter since those are only used to execute user-defined bash commands for incoming print jobs. However, something else has become the main problem with implementing the rest of ippeveprinter: pthreads. Since libcups uses pthread keys to manage its globals, I’ve had issues every time I’ve tried to initiate and store globals. Mainly, pthread_setspecific will return EINVAL since to_posix_thread(pthread_self()) will fail. Inside of pthread_self:

Generally, what I have been seeing myself doing through this process and stage of development is removing all of the parts that would not be feasible to support right now and focusing on the actual application rather than all of the tests for libraries. This is because it’s become clear to me that time is going to be scarce over the next weeks as I have finals for my summer classes and then a significantly more difficult Fall term after that.
