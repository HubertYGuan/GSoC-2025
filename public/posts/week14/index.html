(Also, on a sidenote, this is also not a fast process to debug since every time I do this, it seems I have to reset my access point to avoid DNS-SD resolution issues.)\nNext Steps Since it looks like I’ve probably run out of memory when trying to make an HTTP connection with the client or in some HTTP function, I will try to save as much memory as possible from other parts of the program. However, for future memory concerns as well, I will also look into utilizing the ESP32 boards’ ability to load 4MB of external SPI RAM and then use that for dynamic allocations. After that, the other main hurdle will probably be the libcups HTTP API itself, if it needs some changes to work with Zephyr’s HTTP API. Since ippeveprinter doesn’t really process jobs (besides calling a command, but the command is not specified here), I believe that as long as ippeveprinter can receive the test page data and communicate over HTTP with the printing client, it should be able to “print” test pages and hopefully pass the tests provided. As always, you can check on my progress in the project proposal and design diagram below.\n","wordCount":"1085","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://HubertYGuan.github.io/GSoC-2025/images/openprintingzephyr.png","datePublished":"2025-09-23T16:07:55-07:00","dateModified":"2025-09-23T16:07:55-07:00","author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Hubert Guan"}],"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://HubertYGuan.github.io/GSoC-2025/posts/week14/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Porting Printing to Zephyr - GSoC 2025","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://HubertYGuan.github.io/GSoC-2025/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://HubertYGuan.github.io/GSoC-2025/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://HubertYGuan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">

</code></pre><p>Furthermore, when I use CUPS 2.4.10 to print a test page, I get stuck on the following description for the job</p><pre tabindex=0><code>processing since
&lt;insert start time&gt;
&#34;Connected to printer.&#34;
</code></pre><p>And I also get the latter logs from GDB when I halt the program. (Also, on a sidenote, this is also not a fast process to debug since every time I do this, it seems I have to reset my access point to avoid DNS-SD resolution issues.)</p><h1 id=next-steps>Next Steps<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#next-steps>#</a></h1><p>Since it looks like I’ve probably run out of memory when trying to make an HTTP connection with the client or in some HTTP function, I will try to save as much memory as possible from other parts of the program. However, for future memory concerns as well, I will also look into utilizing the ESP32 boards’ ability to load 4MB of external SPI RAM and then use that for dynamic allocations. After that, the other main hurdle will probably be the libcups HTTP API itself, if it needs some changes to work with Zephyr’s HTTP API. Since ippeveprinter doesn’t really process jobs (besides calling a command, but the command is not specified here), I believe that as long as ippeveprinter can receive the test page data and communicate over HTTP with the printing client, it should be able to “print” test pages and hopefully pass the tests provided. As always, you can check on my progress in the project proposal and design diagram below.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=next
