This will be mainly HTTP for libcups, and then I will see what I can do with PAPPL’s functions as I implement them. Luckily, it seems that PAPPL’s architecture is much more modular and there are testbenches for testing different aspects of the print server (or mainloop). I also want to take another look at the TLS functionality since I am getting a load-prohibited exception in tls-mbedtls.c.\nThen, I can of-course get working on something a bit different, which is ippusb_bridge in Rust. This should hopefully be at least a bit more understandable since the source code files are not very large.\nAs always, you can find the design diagram and project proposals linked below.\nProject Proposal:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1cYL6S2JSkzY0ln1w_s3qwpm85-keB9jaVjGSwyPg5NM/edit?usp=sharing\nDesign Diagram:\nhttps://excalidraw.com/#room=0a35b04c6340f86386ea,xwV6ErRli602L8FTUikm2w\n","wordCount":"593","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://HubertYGuan.github.io/GSoC-2025/images/openprintingzephyr.png","datePublished":"2025-10-10T00:26:46-07:00","dateModified":"2025-10-10T00:26:46-07:00","author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Hubert Guan"}],"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://HubertYGuan.github.io/GSoC-2025/posts/week16/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Porting Printing to Zephyr - GSoC 2025","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://HubertYGuan.github.io/GSoC-2025/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://HubertYGuan.github.io/GSoC-2025/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://HubertYGuan.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">

I also want to take another look at the TLS functionality since I am getting a load-prohibited exception in <code>tls-mbedtls.c</code>.</p><p>Then, I can of-course get working on something a bit different, which is <code>ippusb_bridge</code> in Rust. This should hopefully be at least a bit more understandable since the source code files are not very large.</p><p>As always, you can find the design diagram and project proposals linked below.<br>Project Proposal:<br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cYL6S2JSkzY0ln1w_s3qwpm85-keB9jaVjGSwyPg5NM/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cYL6S2JSkzY0ln1w_s3qwpm85-keB9jaVjGSwyPg5NM/edit?usp=sharing</a></p><p>Design Diagram:<br><a href="https://excalidraw.com/#room=0a35b04c6340f86386ea,xwV6ErRli602L8FTUikm2w">https://excalidraw.com/#room=0a35b04c6340f86386ea,xwV6ErRli602L8FTUikm2w</a></p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://HubertYGuan.github.io/GSoC-2025/posts/weeks17-18/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Week 17/18: Testing with the New Memory Management Scheme</span>
